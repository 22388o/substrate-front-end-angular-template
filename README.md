Work In Progress - Converting [Substrate Front-End Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) from React to Angular with Material Design & rxjs.

Currently, there are several working components (Account Selector, Balances, Block Number, Events, Metadata, Node Info, Transfer), but there are lots of TODO's sprinkled throughout, and duplicated code here and there.

## Using The Template

### Installation

The codebase is installed using `git` and the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli). This tutorial assumes you have installed the Angular CLI globally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tarrball/substrate-angular-template.git
cd substrate-angular-template
npm install
```

### Ussage

You can start the template in development mode to connecct to a locally running node:

```sh
ng serve
```

You can also build the app in production mode:

```sh
ng build --prod
```
